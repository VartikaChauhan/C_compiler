#  Simple C Compiler Using Flex, Bison, and C

## üìù Overview

This project is a **fully functional mini C compiler** developed from scratch using:

- **Flex** for lexical analysis
- **Bison** for syntax parsing
- **C** for compiler logic and semantic analysis

It is designed to parse a subset of the C language and includes a full pipeline from tokenization to semantic analysis and AST evaluation.

---

##  Features

-  **Lexical Analysis** using Flex
-  **Syntax Parsing** with Bison (LALR parser)
-  **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** construction and traversal
-  **Symbol Table Management** for scoped variables and function identifiers
-  **Type Checking** for expressions, assignments, and operations
-  **Undeclared Variable Detection**
-  **Function Declaration & Call Validation**
-  **Error Handling** with informative messages
-  **AST Evaluation & Visualization Support**

##  Requirements

Install the following dependencies:

- [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex)
- [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- Make
- Git (optional, for version control)

---

## For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flex bison gcc build-essential git -y
```

## Build the Compiler
```bash
make
``` 

## Run the Compiler
```bash
./compiler test.c
```
This will parse test.c and perform lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis.

###  .gitignore ‚Äî Ignored Files

This project uses a .gitignore file to exclude automatically generated files from version control, ensuring a clean and portable codebase.
Ignored Binary and Generated Files:
- compiler ‚Äî The compiled output binary.
- *.o ‚Äî Object files generated during compilation.
- lex.yy.c ‚Äî File generated by Flex.
- parser.tab.c, parser.tab.h ‚Äî Files generated by Bison.

These files are regenerated automatically when you run the `make` command, so they do not need to be tracked in the repository.
